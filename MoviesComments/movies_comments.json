Great action - all practical stunts, NO CGI!  Great music, that everything - and I do mean EVERYTHING - is perfectly choreographed to. Great jokes and zingers. Intensely stressful stakes. Stylistically beautiful. An action hero that does American Sign Language. If you like music at all, you'll appreciate this film so much. Do yourself a favor and see Baby Driver. It's endlessly fun, and the soundtrack will be in your head for weeks.", "Kept me with my eyes wide open the whole movie. One of the best movies I've seen in a really long time.", "", "Loved this movie!  Ansel Elgort was lovely in this movie.  The actor has a dance background, which was put to great use for a character who is constantly listening to music on an iPod and communicates through sign language to his foster parent.  There is a wonderful scene where he makes lunch for this dad in a choreographed sequence that reminded me of Gene Kelly waking up in the morning in AN AMERICAN IN PARIS.  There is another wonderful sequence when Elgort is walking down the street to get coffee while listening to his music. He skillfully and gracefully dodges obstacles, maneuvers around people and things, and engages with the environment in a dancing kind of way that matches this playlist.  The dance is handled as much by the camera and the environment as it is by Elgort--quite delightful.  And this whimsy amidst a story of terrible violence and murder, yet there is a great sense of humor laced throughout.  A fresh surprise!", "A movie all these critics like cannot be very good!!

It's essentially 150 minutes of action sequences in slow motion or changing aspect ratios and poorly written exposition that makes no sense and is delivered with the grace, emotion, and talent of a Russian circus bear. The film is filled with Michael Bayisms that are painfully bad and impossible to escape. Throughout the movie I heard multiple people behind me saying how bad it was and three people next to me walked out. Now if you want to laugh at something for its shortcomings this is the movie for you, because there is a metric f**k ton of shortcomings in this movie and they are good for a laugh.

Wanted it more of the Queen and the Aunt, it moved rather quickly from there to the outside world.  * Act 2 - Very slow pace, was not boring but could use some of the time spent in Europe and use it for Themyscira, Steve Trevor's crew was ok, rather had the Amazons.  * Act 3 - Fight scenes leading up to the final fight, incredible!  Wonder Woman is a bad*** but at the same time, has a very caring heart.  The humor in this movie was on point and not forced.  Diana and Steve had such great chemistry.  What shocked me was the movie had a message at the end about humanity, walked out feeling good with a smile.", "It's hard to unseat Back to the Future but Wonder Woman is right there. This Movie gets everything about Wonder Woman right. As she discovers who she is and what she can do Gal Godot's performance is spot on in every nuance.. She goes from determination, to shock and awe, compassion, horror, dissapointment, anger, and finally Realization that while world may be compicated and have darkness in it, her role is to be a guiding light out of that darkness. Her growth to the fierce warrior, compasionate leader, loving princess, and gallant hero is as wonderful as anyone could have hoped it would be. Add in the awesome fight scenes, great spectacles of beauty, and realistic epic battles and you've got a movie for the ages.", "If you weren't a feminist before well, welcome. A must see for any all.

It presents very good symbolic and special themes which are expressed very well if you can understand the message, and is a PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER, NOT a HORROR film.

{"title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales", "comments": ["Originally Written May 26, 2017-- Thrust into an all-new adventure, a down-on-his-luck Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his first mate, Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin R. McNally), feel the winds of ill-fortune blowing even more strongly when deadly ghost sailors led by the evil Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), escape from the Devil's Triangle. Their only hope for survival lies in seeking out the legendary Trident of Poseidon, but to find it, they must forge an uneasy alliance with a brilliant and beautiful astronomer (Kaya Scodelario) and a headstrong young man (Brenton Thwaites) attempting to escape the British navy.  In 2003, Disney embarked on a risky venture. They took the idea behind their famous theme park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean, and turned it into a film that many critics at the time thought would never work. Four films and some $3.7 billion later, that risky idea has turned into an incredibly massive franchise. While wildly entertaining, the last three films failed to capture the magic of that first adventure 14 years ago. But that has all changed with the newest entry in the series --- Dead Men Tell No Tales. I'm happy to report that this fifth film in the franchise has heart, humor, and rollicking adventure!  Depp is just as weird and wacky in his signature role as ever, McNally is wonderfully clever and crafty as his first mate, Bardem is equal parts charismatic and creepy as the cursed Capt. Salazar, and even Geoffrey Rush makes a triumphant appearance as Sparrow's arch-nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa. But the real fun here lies with the two new leads, Scodelario's Carina Smyth and Thwaite's character. I could tell you who he is, but that would spoil one of the film's biggest surprises! Rest assured, the fun and magic of the original film is back. Two thumbs way, way up!", "As a mega fan of pirates I was excited to go for the first showing, sadly I was in for nothing but a let down. Jack has become a parody of himself, the one off characters were perplexing and ridiculous. I was so excited for the strong female character who demands to be taken seriously and holds science in such high regard, I wanted her scientific examination of the supernatural to prevail and hold the key to its undoing but no; scene after scene of horrible writing mixed with plot devices that strained at believability. All in all it was just disappointing.", "Fantastic!  Could be the 2nd best of the 5 films.  Salazar was spectacular. There was one point in the plot I thought was eh, but it went by quick and was worth it for the results.  Excellent movie and a ton of fun.", "All the real funny parts was already seen in the trailers. The movie felt rushed and stitched together in some parts. Areas felt short where they should have explained better, instead spent a great deal of time on things that was just tacked on. The first 3 was way better.", "It's 4 am on a Saturday, and I am still Hangry over last night.  I had eagerly awaited the return of my favorite swashbuckling pirate, Cap'n Jack Sparrow & the beloved crew of the Black Pearl, like one eagerly anticipates the succulent bite of the first steak of the summer grilling season, only to be served an under cooked tasteless meat like imitation of the T-Bone you were dreaming of.   Sure, it looked & smelled like a pirate movie, it had adventure and intrigue.  The main characters individual performances were strong, and compelling and the story line would have been good had it not attempted to package itself under the flagship colors of the Disney Pirates Of The Caribbean name.  I wanted to Love this Movie.  I wanted to have walked away from the theater, full and satisfied, knowing my time spent anticipating this movie was well worth the wait.  But I'm not, on so many levels I'm not.  Like a bad burger this movie left me asking the proverbial question, Where's the Beef?"]}

It is a slow burn that builds, drawing the viewer in, and delivers a devastating climax.  The filmâs use of the vampire mythology reminds one of George Romeroâs Martin or Tomas Alfredsonâs Let the Right One In, while skillfully combing that with the urban landscapes and themes of New York City reminiscent of Spike Leeâs Do the Right Thing or Darren Aronofskyâs Requiem for a Dream.

{"title": "I Called Him Morgan", "comments": ["There is some precious footage in this film, and what I appreciated most was that this wasn't some tawdry account of Lee Morgan's murder -- it told his story, and his common-law-wife's story as well, you got to hear him play, see his fellow musicians in action and hear what they had to say. He did have a serious drug problem, but he beat it, and there's emphasis on his work post-recovery, which is refreshing, no drama about his addiction. No one is trying to blow sunshine up anyone's skirt, you can see the toll it took on his face, but there isn't any lurid preoccupation or pandering to minds that aren't, uh, huge. It's an hour and a half long, and I felt like I had been sitting there for maybe half that time. Go!", "I was hoping the movie focused on Lee Morgan, the musician. That's what it did! Many musicians shared their perspectives on Mr Morgan. The story was told by his wife. Unfortunately the wife had two sides. I strongly recommend seeing the movie. This movie is educational for musicians and music lovers. It teaches us all about Lee Morgan (the trumpet player), good and not good relationships. Music lovers will appreciate it!", "This film is very well crafted. By using numerous rich and bold photos and intimate interviews, it tells a touching and important story of one of the worlds great artist who died way before his time.

The pacing is well managed. The content is bountiful. The topic impressive. A life changing film.", "Don't do anything else in life until you figure out when you're going to see this movie!

(2) If you love images of a city that is blanketed in fresh-fallen snow.  (3) If you love the richness of people recounting past events in a documentary style.  (4) If you know that jazz truly keeps the musicians looking young even when they're older.  (5) If you like the clothing and house stylings from the 1950s through the 70s.

There were so many avenues she could have explored, but instead she uses innuendo & rumor as if gossipy allegations of a sexual nature trump the video footage of murder by the US government shown early in the film. Objectivity was not her purpose. For all of Assangeâs personal faults (none of which are substantiated here) she does not seem to appreciate the actual work of Wikileaks as it reflects the brutality of governmental totalitarian actions. This movie when one applies principles of journalistic integrity proves more damning of Poitras than Assange.", "", "Most of the material in this documentary? we've read of/seen in the papers really.

Took off from work to make it, drove all the way and wasted my time.", "The production was well staged, director Van Hove had some creative ideas within the minimalist presentation. Not everything worked for me but I still appreciated it. The minimalist approach certainly allowed Law and Halina Reijn more freedom to inhabit the roles and physically express their ever-changing emotions throughout the story. Both actors, especially Law, were fully capable of taking over the space. However, I thought the intimacy of this piece was dwarfed by such a large stage, which would probably be more noticeable had I watched it in person, instead of via a live feed. The play itself I felt was a bit underwritten, with many ancillary characters being underdeveloped and not making much sense or just being plain unnecessary within the story of these two doomed lovers. But Law's trademark electricity and passion held it together. The only real disappointment was the visual quality of the feed (not HD in this day and age?) and the distracting out of sync sound."]}

Immediately.  Easily one of the best animated films ever made, Japanese or otherwise, it's a beautifully drawn, heart-tugging story about two sisters and their encounter with a mysterious forest spirit.  For a film made in 1988, it holds up extremely well.  The print quality at the screening I went to was beautiful, clean and devoid of film scratches.  While some people may miss the FOX English dub, the replacement by Disney, featuring Dakota and Elle Fanning as the two sisters, is more than acceptable.  Both perform their roles very well and the supporting cast does fine, too.  Only nitpicks:  occasional mistimed lines, OP song is a bit too gungho, and a few underacted moments, but otherwise a solid dub.

No explanation as to why the mask guards were on, and even though they were painful looking, no scars. That was just one of many shortcuts, you have to guess what happened between scenes. All about head shots of the actors suffering or emoting, but no tie together of the plot.

{"title": "Nobody Speak: Trials of the Free Press", "comments": ["The new Netflix Original Nobody Speak Trials of the free press starts out as a Hulk Hogan vs. Gawker story where it seems to start to go the way of man vs. abusive press. As the documentary progresses, one soon finds out this is not the case. It becomes a vehicle for spin as to why the powers that were at Gawker feel they were wronged for running with and publishing a selectively edited sex tape secretly made of Hulk Hogan and a radio jockey's **** wife. Most of the first 34 of the documentary covers the absolute beating Hogan and his lawyers continuously dish out to the people most liable at Gawker. All the while it also includes jabs here and there after the fact as to why Gawker should have been absolved of any wrongdoings and shielded by the First Amendment... of course straight from the mouths of the people directly responsible and their supporters. Throughout the program, there is an ever present Liberal shift going on that increases as the story progresses. CNN is prominently displayed at each turn with MSNBC in an attempt to coax the viewer to believe what is being said is backed up by other separate news organizations. A grand conspiracy-like connection is made and is suppose to be a huge shadow that mysteriously cost Gawker the trial although it has nothing to do with the case or deciding the case in court. No thought is ever given or considered on screen by the former news outlet as to the personal, intellectual, and professional damages that have been dealt to Hogan other than to mention there should have been more damage by additional footage being released. Once we find out the end result of the civil case and that Gawker will be closed and bankrupt the whole program shifts into a mix of anti-Trump and anti-Republican tirades and rhetoric. Videos are presented of the numerous run-ins between the media (mainly CNN) and Trump before and after the 2016 Presidential Election with selective editing and commentary full of disdain for Trump and his so-called shutting down of the press. The liberal views are front and foremost typically leaving out pertinent information. Although somewhat informative when guarding with skepticism, the documentary falls flat on its face trying to save face. The recent outing of the CNN brand of news unknowingly by its own anchors and producer pushing nothing burger fake news shines a bright light as to what this documentary is really about especially when they use so much of CNN's broadcasts. It is a desperate attempt at misdirection and to shift blame from those at Gawker who were held accountable. The writers and producers of the documentary as well as the various supporting cast of news editors, publishers, and reporters appear as fools, after the CNN debacle, pushing nothing burgers of their own and are no more credible in this reviewer's eyes than CNN."]}

{"title": "A Quiet Passion", "comments": ["See it! I absolutely loved Terence Davies' A Quiet Passion. A rich, moving, emotional biography. The attention to detail remarkable and painstaking. Costumes gorgeous and accurate. Wonderful to hear Dickinson's poetry. The shape of the house, the grave evoke the shape of her manuscripts on scraps of paper. One comes away understanding why she did not publish more in her lifetime. She was ahead of her time. She protected her process and poetry. You will experience her 'quiet passion', experience what life was like for her. See, if you can, the exhibit at The Morgan Library in NYC. You will see how one of her published poems was dwarfed midst a sea of newspaper text and ads. Davies has done our brilliant Emily justice. All the actors are wonderful. It is a jewel of a masterpiece.", "If you are a Fast and Furious fan this film is not for you - Don't see it if you want action rather than substance - this is all about the substance of a human journey.  This is a slowly developed, exquisitely detailed study of the emotional and spiritual development of Emily Dickinson ... The wit of Emily Dickinson and the other repressed/oppressed women in her circle provides some relief from the painful journey with Emiiy's soul ... It was a mixed sense of relief when the torture of the soul ended ... very moving ... a masterpiece. The cinematography and lighting were perfect- drew me in immediately -", "The acting was exceptional but the monotonous flow of the movie actually had both me and the mrs nod off for a good 20 mins", "Appreciated the weave of Dickinson poetry throughout the film.  The flow between time periods and events abrupt; lending well to the poetic readings, but difficult for a viewer learning about her life.  Beautifully acted.", "About half way through the movie I began praying that the film makers would not stoop to using because I could not stop for death... to close the film at Emily's impending and inevitable death. But no, they could not resist. After two hours of being bludgeoned by witty repartee and torrents of tears interrupted only by confusing non-familial relationships, they could not resist illustrating each line on crystal clarity lest we, presumably people who had some interest in the poetess, miss the meaning of it all. One final blow of the cudgel after two hours of long shaky views of tiny rooms and too many questionable dialogues.   I heard one person whisper to another 'was this filmed at her home?' a reasonable question since we were within easy driving distance of Amherst. That trip and a free pamphlet would have been more satisfying and informative.   Save two hours and movie money, buy some poems by Emily Dickinson and go to Amherst and you'll be well-served, with or without popcorn."]}

Fair amount of icky Alien gore so I felt I got my Alien Horror fix satisfied somewhat.  The biggest drawback was so many gaping holes in the plot for a sci-fi geek like me.  Above all, once again, like in Prometheus, what's with the petting unknown alien life forms like they are bunnies or puppies at a petting zoo.  Didn't any of these writers ever read or see Michael Crichton's classic The Andromeda Strain where he described the kind of laboratory & scientific methods alien life forms need to be handled with?  Like with mechanical hands in tightly sealed lab rooms.  Not by hand, even with rubber gloves--no one is shocked when the nasty Alien monster just bites through.  Although the one in this movie makes itself a home made 'shank' in the lab to cut through the rubber gloves and escape.  Smart, vicious little Alien.  Enjoy.", "", "I love Sci Fi but this blatantly plagiaristic movie is not going to be classic, Ridley Scott has nothing to worry about. Like in most PC movies the lead scientist is the least likely to be the lead scientist,(see: Dr. James Watt) then a mention of Syria and how humans suck and a comment about seeing borders from space. The usual f ilm a ctors g uild propaganda. The creepiest thing in this flick is Jake Gyllenhaal's grin (The one from Donnie Darko).

You could see what was coming from a mile away. Imagery and emotion were so forced. Cinematography and directing was awful/lacking. Someone tried to catch scenic shots like in Gravity w/ Clooney & Bullock, but missed the mark terribly.   Not to mention, the scene where they're swaying at a table to give the allusion of low gravity--awful! And I got a headache in the beginning from the unnecessary camera spinning around shots. If I was a scientist or in the dept of defense I would be insulted by the crew's portrayal. The people that go on space missions are highly trained and SMART!

{"title": "Logan (2017)", "comments": ["Logan is the last film in the trilogy of Wolverine films, but also marks Hugh Jackman's last performance as Wolverine in the X-Men universe. The film also marks Patrick Stewarts last outing as Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men universe. So, how does this last outing film hold up? Is it good, is it bad, is it ok? Let's dive into it, shall we?   Off of first impressions, I am completely blown away by this film. It is totally different than any X-Men, heck any Wolverine film before it! Hugh Jackman himself did an absolutely beautiful job on this film. I could tell that he literally put everything into this film and it definitely does show in this film as well. Patrick Stewarts portrayal of a aging and trash talking Charles Xavier was hilarious but at times really touching. I honestly felt that the two, Jackman and Stewart, were a great pairing for this film. But it was interesting how with this film being rather serious and very brutal, oh so brutal, there were comedic moments that actually within that type of story. When a film can do that, do it successfully that is, I am always impressed, as I am with this film. The girl who played X-23 was also extremely good. For a kid actor, she was very good within this R rated film. There are so many other actors who played their roles extremely well, but everyone really did a great job.   The story was also very touching, saying it's technically about the last days of Wolverine. The characters within it all serve there purpose, and honestly I don't feel that any character was wasted at all. Every person had a reason for being on screen, and it made the story that much better because of it. Essentially, the story arch is a road trip, so we meet different people, while Logan is being pursued by, basically, Mutant hunters. X-23 and Logan do not get a long at first, but as the film progresses, they do form a strong bond. The plot line with Xavier was also very interesting. Through it we learn what has happened in the past 15-20 years. We also learn of what he is capable of now and what effects it has, which just saying, is extremely bad. The whole plot line for X-23 was also interesting and very close to Wolverines backstory, which makes sense when you think about it. So story wise, really on point.   Action wise, holy crap. When there was action, there was action. I'm glad this film was rated R because to fully see what Wolverine and even X-23 were capable of, it had to be done in a R rated film. A PG-13 film could not do this justice, it wouldn't even come close. The kills in this film are also extremely brutal. I mean, rated R brutal, and by that I mean so brutal that it's not for the weak hearted at all! You have limbs and heads and everything getting cut-off, so, yeah, action and killings extremely brutal, but extremely awesome as well.   The final thing I want to touch on is the mutant hunting group. Headed by Richard E. Grant's character, they claim that they can control mutants by killing them and mixing tissues together. There's one thing they make that I won't spoil, that probably could've been left out, but at the same time, it was actually pretty awesome to see. The man with the metal hand too was a loyal servant for the mutant hunters, and he had a few moments where he was pretty clever. And the interesting bit is, if you remember the original X-Men films, apparently this group is based off the same program that gave Logan his claws, heck it runs in the family, not going to explain how though, you gotta see the film to find out.   Overall though, when it comes down to how good this film really was, it was the best X-Menish film Fox has made for awhile. The direction behind it, the acting, the story, everything, was just perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better film. Logan is truly a great film and I highly recommend that everyone, who is above 18, no kids, go see this film and witness the last chapter in The Wolverine and Professor X story. You will not be disappointed!", "The movie is amazing.... the R rating suits the movie, and the language doesn't seem forced.... the violence is in point... and the drama is amazing.... it's a must watch", "From the very beginning the movie felt disjointed. It seemed like they were trying to give the movie an edgy violence similar to Deadpool. Because of this, the characters were not at all what you've come to expect through the other Xmen movies. The storyline leaves you wondering throughout a majority of the movie, What is going on? and Why is this happening? That having been said, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman deliver great performances, but not even they can right this sinking ship.", "After 17 years in nine films as the Wolverine, Hugh Jackman outing as the Wolverine comes to a close. Watching this movie from start to finish has become easily one of my favorite films thus far. A story taken from the graphic novel of the Old Man Logan story that tells the struggle and life of Logan. This film is absolutely amazing and the new character, X-23, well let's just say she's a bad*** along side her daddy. The best Marvel movie of this year that happens to be an R-rated cinema. Great movie with action and brutality as the way Wolverine should be.", "I liked the movie"]}

The signing and composing were poor attempts to tie plot lines together, yet they have nothing to add to the film.

Lucic, Pape & Calleja were strong singing and acting presences in their roles of Macbeth, Banquo and Macduff, respectively. The minor role of Malcolm was also well sung and acted. Banquo's ghost at the banquet was very cleverly presented, also the vision of future kings. Having recently studied this opera (with a wonderful recording), I was looking forward to this encore of a live performance. However, I am not a fan of the updated settings and costuming. The witches looked more like refugees than a malevolent coven. The soldiers' uniforms & especially their weapons were distracting. Lady Macbeth seemed properly attired in only the banquet scene. Birnam Wood did not have even the appearance of its prediction, just vertical sticks, not leafy branches. The chairs were odd, and the walk-away end of Lady Macbeth was just strange."]}

A crossblend of Chronicle meets The Breakfast Club but surprisingly it works! The character development was a real surprise since in the original Power Rangers series, that didn't exactly exist. There's a good blend of cheesiness that fans that watched MMPR grew up with as well as solid storytelling to make for a great time. If you go into this expecting for a purist Xerox of what you watched growing up, you'll be disappointed. But if you go into this with an open mind looking to have a fun time, you won't be disappointed. I was very impressed with the overall performances of the entire cast especially Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa and RJ Cyler as Billy. Fans of the franchise and even those who didn't bother to care for it before should watch this. It's a very fun film that makes you feel like a kid again. As they said in the 90s, It's Morphing Time", "As a 24 year old, I never really got into Power Rangers growing up. Went because my boyfriend wanted to watch it, but I have to say, it was pretty good. Better than what I expected. Very cheesy (but it is a kids movie, so I get that), very funny, but not a lot of Ranger action (hence the three stars). It had a more Breakfast Club feel to it.

{"title": "The Lost City of Z", "comments": ["There's a lot of melodrama and unfocused writing in this film, and it drags on for 2.5 hours. If a film offers to take its audience on 3 repetitive trips to the Amazonian jungle, it has to deliver on the visuals at the very least. But sadly, each trip to the jungle was less rewarding than the last. The actors climbed through the same dense jungle terrain again and again in slightly different clothes and progressively more makeup so as to age them the 5 years that had passed between each trip.", "Few films go out of their way to stay in tune with the plush details and tone of an era and now throwing in modern adventure and action sequences while staying fresh and intriguing. James Gray was able to do that here. Sit back in your seat and take it all in. I didn't need Percy to be a modern day Indiana Jones, he was plagued with obsessive conquest and failed. That truth was warranted and honest. It didn't take away from the journey and truth of their experiences. I thought Sienna was enlightening. She really impressed as well did most of the cast. Charlie really led this adventure and Pattinson sure impressed.", "Enticed by reports of grand cinematography (Roeper) I expected good things but found the acting hard to watch (got sick of lead actor's changeless expression) and found the filmography surprisingly drab, flat, lifeless - like it was shot on a back lot.  I read the book and it was NOT brought to life by the bad screen play. The movie was scattered, fractured,  unbelievable. Paramount in the book were the insect plagued hardships - the movie showed exactly one (1) bug that I could see.  There were many strange, disconcerting bits:  - 1st trip was to survey and trace a river to its source. In the film this was done by ... drifting UPstream! - surveyor shots were of two guys standing a few yards apart and looking at a big ruled pole. - ALL the deep jungle natives spoke Spanish. Huh? Convenient. - WWI experiences portrayed were just silly. - In the movie, Fawcett spoke at the Royal Geographic Society and was loudly, almost violently jeered for suggesting an ancient high civilization in the jungle. The next minute (literally) he had a rousing 100% ovation for his return to search for Z. Huh?  The real life Fawcett inspired the Indiana Jones stories. Indeed he had a following (in the US) of millions eagerly awaiting his reports. But the film just utterly failed to capture that feeling the same as it failed to capture much of anything in a credible way.", "It was an interesting movie, but way too long. I also thought they didn't capture the essence of the obsession with finding the lost city. However, it was very interesting and perhaps I rate it a little higher because I previously read the book and had some additional context that others may not have.", "What a snooze fest!!!!

In all good conscience how could the film makers make us so vulnerable by having us identify so closely with the Snow Leopard family and then show such cruel footage at the conclusion. With all of Disney's resources, which we were shown, which included cameras, tons of equipment, as well as tremendous man power, why couldn't they have brought a Vet team to minister to the wounded, dying Snow Leopard mother. Ironically, World Wildlife Federation, who promoted this film, has a section of the website saving the endangered Snow Leopards! Well, here are two orphaned Snow Leopard cubs you can start with.  In conclusion, if you love cats or animals in general do not see this movie.  You will be deeply troubled and shocked by its ending.", "The movie is beautifully shot and does a great job showing some of the gorgeous landscape of China and four of its native species. I really do wish that I had known beforehand that one of the four animals they track and her babies die (we only see the body of the mother, but the cubs are too young to defend themselves or hunt). One of the young girls in the theater started screaming and crying (I was crying myself and left the theater feeling sad and angry).  It may not be the best movie for some people even with the 'circle of life' stuff they spout at the end.", "the ending was not what one would expect in a Disney  family friendly movie.  I'm sure the crew were instructed not to interfere with nature but in this case I disagree with that decision.     My last DisneyNature movie.", "Normally I didn't write review for movies. However, I highly highly recommend this movie! It is amazing!", "The animals were adorable and hilarious. I always enjoy learning about the lives of creatures in other parts of the world. HOWEVER one of the main characters dies and it broke my heart. Disney tried to tie it back to the circle of life, but it was really devastating for me. I even get sad when the prey gets caught. So definitely go support DisneyNature, just be cautious if you are sensitive to dying animals (even if it happens every day in nature)."]}
{"title": "Gifted", "comments": ["What makes Gifted stand out is the performances in it. The story is straightforward and nothing that breaks new ground, but it doesn't have to. If you're looking for a story with heart and family, then I'd say watch it. Fun dialogue, a great kid actor, and a heartwarming experience. I think it's good to take a break from all the explosions every now and then and just watch a nice story. It's nice to see Captain America take on a more real role. Chris Evans does excellent work in the Marvel films, but every now and then he does something else to remind us that he really can do anything. It's refreshing to see. Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer, The Amazing Spider-Man) delivers a story with good pacing and makes you feel for the characters. I don't think it's a movie you HAVE to see in the theater, but it's better than most of the newer releases. If you're saving your money for Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2, then you can catch this on Netflix or VOD later.", "This is a heartwarming movie with an extraordinary cast. This child actress (McKenna Grace) is fantastic. I feel she is much better than child star Dakota Fanning was at this age. I was impressed by the emotions displayed by this newcomer.  The story line is something we have all seen before; but the acting and the directors vision of the screenplay makes it a memorable film. It is well worth your theater dollars and time. A few cuss words; but only one F word if I recall correctly. This is a must see film for the insight of single parenting and foster homes. The effects on all concerned in trying circumstances is well addressed. I highly recommend this movie for an enjoyable night out.", "Gifted**** term is thrown around too often in 2017....

It shows the circumstances of Arthur's upbringing. It closes with his revenge on his uncle.

As we attended a showing this evening, we truly hoped that we would enjoy it as much as we have loved the 1991 film. I'm ecstatic to say that this new version is fantastic!

How else could one explain this thing ever being made? Many have advised to wait and watch this on cable, I recommend cutting your cable first!", "All 4 funny scenes were shown on the trailors!  This movie as an epic fail.  This was a crossed between Weekend At Bernies, meets a WATERED-DOWN Bridesmaid!!  Was not worth my money!!!  Wait until it goes to Netflix!!!!", "??????? ???????", "", "Worst comedy I've ever seen"]}
{"title": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2", "comments": ["Originally Written May 4, 2017-- Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and his fellow Guardians are hired by a powerful alien race, the Sovereign, to protect their precious batteries from invaders. When it is discovered that Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) has stolen the items they were sent to guard, the Sovereign dispatch their armada to search for vengeance. As the Guardians try to escape, the mystery of Peter's parentage is revealed.  You would think that after nine years and over a dozen movies that Marvel Studios would run out of ideas for its films. Or at the very least, they would make one that isn't amazing, incredible, and destined to gross a billion dollars. But it still hasn't happened! James Gunn, writer and director of the original 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' returns here for the fantastic and fun sequel. While there are ultimately lots of reasons why this film is so good, the inclusion of Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) is inspired because he absolutely steals the movie! Warner Bros. and DC Comics have nothing on their comic book counterparts. Congratulations Marvel on another blockbuster!", "THIS WAS THE BEST MCU MOVIE SO FAR OF THIS YEAR!!! ITS BETTER THAN THE 1st ONE!!!!!", "The writing and directing leaves a lot to be desired. Jokes are pretty bad, storyline pops up out of no where, and it is very slow. There never seems to truly be a villain and the movie just dragged on. Not enough real conflict to pull any heart strings. Weak movie that gets stars because the guardians themselves are cool. Groot is far and away the best part of the movie.", "Considering that I was a child, of the 80's, I can, honestly, say that [the Music of] GUARDIANS Of The GALAXY, Vol. 2 was a True Flashback, of Pure Nostalgia â having grown-up, listening to the likes, of FLEETWOOD MAC, and CHEAP TRICK!  The Movie Trailers are only the Opening Salvo, for what is [to date] The BEST DAMN MARVELÂ© MOVIE, YET!  Yep, STAN LEE has a Cameo!  Finally: take your hand, and Count the Number of Fingers, that You have, on that Hand, because that's How Many BONUS SCENES there are, in the End Credits!  Iâ¦ Amâ¦ GROOT!!! [translated: Summerâ¦ Hasâ¦ ARRIVED!!!]", "Saw the double feature and the two flow very well together. This outing we get more backstory on the characters that seemed to fall into the background on the first run. Yes.... there are a few too many one liners, and cameos are over the top, but this is a great Guardians movie. Drax and Rocket are forefront and Yondu has plenty of screen time (I'm Mary Poppins) and most of the unanswered questions are resolved. Overall, great movie and well worth seeing more than once."]}
{"title": "The Book of Henry", "comments": ["The trailer makes this film look like a unique, intriguing suspense-filled drama. However, be warned that this is a grossly misleading depiction of the film. In toto, the story I was expecting and wanting comprises only about the last half hour of the entire film. And even the way in which that act comes together is so implausible that it's very challenging, in spite of the great acting by the entire cast (which is the sole reason I gave two stars instead of the one star it actually deserves), to buy into the story. Embedded into the film is a completely unexpected -- not to mention totally unnecessary -- plot twist about which I had any inkling existed would have dissuaded me from seeing the film. My friend and I saw a Thursday evening screening before its official release today, and we, along with the other six viewers in our theater, were caught completely off guard by this already heavy story taking an even more depressing turn if there's a limit on watching the suffering of children, this movie exceeds it. And the amount of time that is spent focusing on this totally unadvertised plot twist and its aftermath is wrung out for every last morose micro-droplet. By the time I was actually watching the movie I had expected to see, I just wanted it to be over. But, no. Instead, thus begins the absurdity of a story so unbelievable that you can't help but be indignant that the writer and director think the audience so nitwitted as to believe that this is even a remotely conceivable scenario. Without revealing details there's a scene in which Naomi Watts runs across a bridge, in plain view of anyone who might be driving or walking by, toting an assault rifle half the length of her own body that actually made me laugh because of its farfetchedness. The two young male actors are terrific (the young female actor gives believable facial expressions, but has minimal dialogue), and the cast as a whole has palpable chemistry, but that big, and very BLEAK plot twist ruined it for me, my friend, and our fellow moviegoers based on our and their clear grumbling at the movie's end.", "We liked the book of Henry the south Florida herald and sun sentinel liked it too. Don't know why rotten tomatoes on fandango  disliked it so.. So much junk out there. Glad we didn't go by rotten tomatoes critics.", "What a great, touching sensitive and suspenseful movie. Some mature innuendos, so  suggest over 12 - 14 years of age, but no sex, nudity or violence, Will recommend this movie to all my friends. Critics are obviously clueless about what is entertaining.", "Despite what critics have said, this is actually a very good movie! The acting is superb! Naomi Watts and all of the child actors brought this film to life in a way that I think no one else could, and the expressions and dance by Maddie Ziegler made Christina's plight obvious and heartbreaking. You can see why her character finally moved the others in the film to try to help her. I do have a warning, however:  the story does take you on an emotional roller coaster, but it's done well. It didn't seem jarring to me at all, as some critics have claimed. Life, after all, has its sudden ups and downs. We need more movies like this in Hollywood.", "Loved every frame of the film. Characters were so awesome, writing, as always, entertaining in every way. I am a hardcore film fanatic and this was the most unique and satisfying film I've seen in so long. I will be emailing you with more detail shortly but my message to filmgoers who read the professional critics reviews when deciding whether or not to see something is this- they have it wrong so far.  This story is so refreshing. By the way- also one of the best teaser trailers I've seen executed. It gives NOTHING away and is that rare occasion where both the trailer and the film are A+. I could go on and on but the naysayers are likely already thinking this is one of those planted reviews. I can assure you it is not."]}
{"title": "Beatriz at Dinner", "comments": ["Trailer describe it as a comedy but it's in reality very dark and sad at the end . Amazing performances by all actors . Great dialogues . Some scenes leaves you with question mark, specially the ending ....", "This film is deep and wide.  Powerful, timely, and intimate on many levels.  This is about our earth, our people, greed, empathy, and loss.  None of it struck me as confusing.  Interpret the ending how you will, but the message for me was quite clear.  The tidal wave is overwhelming and people aren't paying attention or hearing the remedy.  We need relief.  Selma, writers and directors need a serious award for this.", "While the acting in this movie was good, the subject matter was politically based, and some scenes were quite disturbing. Left feeling depressed and emotionally drained. It's not that I expect to feel good when exiting a movie, but I certainly don't want to feel like every single character in the film should seek professional help immediately. Sorry. A waste of my $", "Waste of time and money.  Short film. The movie ends and you're left with the feeling of, that's it? Loose ends left untied. Don't bother. Hollywood at it's best throwing politics into a movie.", "SPOILER ALERT:  MT (Salma Hayek) w/ zero ethics, drinks excessively, smokes oncology clientâs pot, shown pondering then killing her clientâs friend/boss(?), then kills herself.

{"title": "The Beguiled (2017)", "comments": ["I dont understand the people who say that this movie was horrible.  It was very good!   I loved the many scenes without background music, allowing only the morning sounds of birds chirping outside and the rustllng of the leaves, which allowed the audience to feel the underlying sexual tension in the house.  I think the the actresses did an excellent performance of gradually competing against each other for the attentions of a man in the house, especially an attractive man like Colin Farrell.  The movie gets five stars from me.", "Sofia Coppola thinks that a slow narrative and some foggy cinematography make a great intellectual movie . The Beguiled is just horrible , despite great acting performances from all the actors . Boring with random laughs , did not deliver. I can't believe she won best director at the Cannes Film Festival for this .", "The movie was amazing! It's gonna give you that HOLY OMG KINDA THING! Must watch you guys ! Totally worth !", "What could have been a remarkable movie became a lukewarm mess! Too bad so sad!", "If you saw the coming attractions then you know most of the movie's plot.  The photography does not have enough light.  Maybe this was meant to be artistic.  However, it's not artistic, it's just annoying."]}
{"title": "All Eyez on Me", "comments": ["So let's talk about this Tupac movie, I have to admit I might be a little bias about it because I'm a huge admire and fan of him. I was first introduced like really introduced and understood him by my mother at the age of 8 or 9, I mean of course I heard him on the radio before then but again I say really able to hear him, relate to what he was saying, appreciate his art by my mother.. So what that being said the man that played Tupac did a amazing job, now again this is my opinion, I think Demetrius Shipp Jr, did a excellent portrayer of Mr Shakur.. I love the breakdown they had while he was in Clinton Correctional Facility, the interview and the flashbacks were done good to me, especially how in depth they went in with him and his  mothers relationship, it was depicted very well. The lovely and beautiful Danai Gurira did well as Miss Afeni Shakur, she definitely capture her love, emotion and struggle well, you could definitely feel it.. I really enjoyed this film. ????????????????", "Tupac deserved so much better than this..they left out so much personal information as well as his relationships with his closest friends & family. I just felt like they focused too much on the biggie beef & his relationship with Jada which is information everyone already knew...The main thing that upset me the way they portrayed his mother Afeni..they made her out to be a crackhead he whole movie & not the BLACK QUEEN he referred to her as!!!! Point Blank waste of money. I felt like this would have been better off as a lifetime movie maybe then I wouldn't be so upset.", "Definitely a great film. You can't argue that. There were some parts that I felt that should've been added in like Pac's last words and/or the second shooting after Pac was shot. That's police files. And the shooting scene at the end in Vegas. Was a good scene. But the crash from Suge. And when they pulled Pac out the car. The song playing was off to me. I would've kept it silent. Sometimes you don't need music. The song was very benediction like when church is about to let out & you know that collection plate is coming around. But overall. The movie was good. It moved along well. Prior to watching it, k was wondering if some of his childhood scenes would feel like it's dragging. But it didn't at all. If anything. It was very fast paced. Pac was played well. It was good. But I do wonder why I'm Notorious they chose to show Big not present when Pac got off the elevator whereas in this film Big was upstairs looking at Pac with Big. I wonder why that scene has discrepancy in it self.", "", "Like PAC is the greatest rapper of all time  This movie is the Goat  It brought me back to 94 living in Cali"]}
